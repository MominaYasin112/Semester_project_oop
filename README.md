# Student Skill Exchange System

A platform that enables students to share knowledge and learn from peers by exchanging skills. Students can offer their expertise in certain areas while learning new skills from others.

## System Architecture

The application uses a modular, object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns. It's built around skill exchange where students register skills, browse available skills, and initiate exchanges.

### Core Components

**Student Management**: Handles registration, profiles, and skill portfolios including offered skills, requested skills, and exchange history.

**Skill Exchange Engine**: Manages skill offerings, requests, and matches students based on complementary needs.

**Authentication**: Provides secure access control and session management.

**User Interface**: GUI for navigating skills, managing profiles, and communicating with exchange partners.

**Communication System**: Enables coordination between students during exchanges.

## System Overview

### Student Management
Students maintain profiles with their skills portfolio, including skills they can teach and skills they want to learn. The AuthenticationManager handles secure login and registration.

### Skill Exchange Process
- **Skill Classification**: Skills are categorized with descriptions and proficiency requirements
- **Offered Skills**: Students list skills they can teach with availability and preferences
- **Requested Skills**: Students specify skills they want to learn with priorities and preferences
- **Exchange Coordination**: The Exchange class manages the entire process from matching to completion

### Matching System
The system matches students with complementary skill needs, considering factors like skill level compatibility and availability.

### Communication
ChatManager and Message classes provide communication channels for coordinating exchanges, scheduling sessions, and sharing resources.

### Data Management
- Custom data structures for efficient storage and searching
- Temporal management for scheduling and deadlines
- String handling for descriptions and communication

### User Interface
- Main hub for accessing all functionalities
- Skill management interfaces
- Exchange tracking and history
- Secure login system

## Technical Implementation

### Design Principles
- **Inheritance**: User-Student hierarchy
- **Composition**: Flexible relationships between students, skills, and exchanges
- **Encapsulation**: Clean interfaces for operations

### Key Algorithms
- Matching logic for complementary skills
- Exchange optimization based on compatibility
- Recommendation system for potential exchanges

## Usage

1. **Registration**: Students register and create profiles
2. **Skill Management**: Add offered skills and learning requests
3. **Discovery**: Browse available skills from peers
4. **Exchange**: Request skills, get matched, and coordinate learning
5. **Communication**: Use integrated messaging for coordination
6. **Completion**: Track progress and provide feedback
